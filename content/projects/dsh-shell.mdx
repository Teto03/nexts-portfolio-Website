The DSH Shell is a straightforward implementation of a shell in the C programming language. It provides basic functionalities such as executing commands, managing paths, redirecting output, and using pipes.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement a basic shell in C. It includes essential features for command execution and process management, making it a useful learning tool for understanding shell internals.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute commands specified within the system path.
- **Path Management**: Set the command search path using the `setpath` command.
- **Output Redirection**: Redirect output using the symbols `>` and `>>`.
- **Pipes**: Support for pipes using the `|` symbol.

## Technical Details

- **Code Structure**:
  - `panic`: Prints an error message and terminates execution.
  - `prompt`: Displays the shell prompt and reads user input.
  - `set_path`: Sets the search path for commands.
  - `path_lookup`: Searches for a command within the specified path.
  - `rel2abs`: Converts a relative path into an absolute path.
  - `do_redir`: Handles output redirection.
  - `do_pipe`: Manages the use of pipes.
  - `do_exec`: Executes a command.
  - `main`: Governs the shell's lifecycle.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile the code, use the following command:
```bash
$ gcc -o dsh dsh.c
```

To execute the shell, use the command:
```bash
$ ./dsh
```

## Notes

- This project is intended as an educational example and does not include all the features of a full-fledged shell.
- Due to the use of the `sys/wait` library, the code must be executed in a **Linux environment**. It will not function on Windows.
