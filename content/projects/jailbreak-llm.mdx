# Jailbreak LLM Response Classifier

This project focuses on the detection and analysis of responses generated by language models under adversarial prompts, developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis.

## Overview

The project combines supervised learning techniques with unsupervised analysis to classify and understand how language models respond to jailbreak attempts and adversarial prompts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **BERT**: For natural language processing and classification
- **Machine Learning**: Various ML techniques for response classification
- **NLP**: Natural language processing for text analysis
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework

## Key Features

- Detection of jailbreak attempts in LLM responses
- Classification of response types and safety levels
- Analysis of adversarial prompt effectiveness
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics and reporting

## Research Focus

The research investigates how large language models behave when subjected to adversarial prompts designed to bypass their safety mechanisms, providing insights into model robustness and security.

## Status

Currently in development as part of my 2024-2025 academic year bachelor's thesis project.
