The Prolog OOP Extension is a project that introduces object-oriented programming capabilities to Prolog. It provides a set of predicates for defining classes, creating instances, managing inheritance, and invoking methods.

## Overview

This extension allows developers to define classes, create instances, and perform type checks. It also supports inheritance, field extraction, and method invocation, making Prolog more versatile for modern programming paradigms.

## Features

- **Class Definition**: Define new classes with fields and methods.
- **Instance Creation**: Create instances of classes with type-checked fields.
- **Inheritance**: Support for single and multiple inheritance.
- **Field Access**: Extract field values from instances and classes.
- **Method Handling**: Define and invoke methods with support for inheritance.
- **Type Checking**: Ensure field values conform to declared types.

## Technical Details

- **Primitives**:
  - `def_class`: Define a new class.
  - `make`: Create a new instance of a class.
  - `is_class`: Check if a symbol represents a valid class.
  - `is_instance`: Verify if a value is a valid instance of a class.
  - `field` and `fieldx`: Extract field values from instances.
- **Utility Functions**:
  - `check_parts`, `check_parts_instance`, `is_valid`, `valid_value`, and more.
- **Inheritance**:
  - Extract superclass fields and methods using `all_superclasses`.
  - Ensure field types in subclasses are compatible with superclasses.
- **Method Handling**:
  - Define methods using `process_methods`.
  - Invoke methods using `call_methods`.
